Calculating a budget for a software project is a complex task involving several factors. There is no universal magic formula, but it is possible to follow a structured algorithm that takes into account the main variables. Below is a step-by-step algorithm for calculating a software project budget, considering:

* **Software Type:** (e.g., Web, Mobile, API, ERP, E-commerce, etc.)
* **Project Complexity:** (e.g., Basic, Medium, Complex)
* **Project Size:** (in hours or story points, if using agile methodology)
* **Technologies Involved:** (e.g., React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
* **Team Seniority:** (Junior, Mid-level, Senior)
* **Areas of Expertise:** Front-end, Back-end, Full Stack.

* **Operational Costs and Profit Margin.**

### **Algorithm: Software Project Budget Calculation**

**1. Initial Project Definition**

* **1.1. Identify the Software Type:** Determine the nature of the product (Web, Mobile, Desktop, API, etc.). This influences the technologies and the necessary team.

* **1.2. Collect Basic Requirements:** Initial survey of functionalities, business rules, external integrations, security, scalability, etc.

* **1.3. Assess Complexity:** Classify the project into levels such as Basic, Medium, or Complex. A complex project will require more time for analysis, architecture, and robust development.

**2. Scope Planning and Estimation**

* **2.1. Breaking the Project into Tasks/Components:** Use techniques such as WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) or create User Stories and Tasks in agile methodologies.

**2.2. Estimating Effort:** Assign working hours to each task/component. This estimate should be made by experienced professionals or based on similar previous projects.

Example: Requirements Analysis: 40h, Front-end Development: 120h, Back-end Development: 80h, Testing: 40h, Deployment: 8h. Estimated total = 288h.

**3. Defining Team Composition**

**3.1. Identifying the Necessary Profile(s):** Determine which roles are needed (Requirements Analyst, UI/UX Designer, Front-end Developer, Back-end Developer, Full Stack Developer, QA, DevOps, etc.).

**3.2. Allocate Resources by Profile and Seniority (considering only one person on the team):**

* Example:

* 1 x Full Stack Developer (288 total project hours)

**4. Define Hourly Rates by Profile and Seniority**

* **4.1. Research market rates.**

* Hourly rates can vary significantly based on region, company experience, professional reputation, and market demand.

** * **Examples of gross monthly salary ranges (January/2026 - Brazil):**
* **Junior:** R$ 3,000 - R$ 5,999
* **Mid-level:** R$ 6,000 - R$ 7,999
* **Senior:** R$ 8,000 - R$ 12,000+
* Converting to **hourly rate (considering 220 hours/month):**
* **Junior:** R$ 13.64 - R$ 27.27 /h
* **Mid-level:** R$ 27.27 - R$ 36.36 /h
* **Senior:** R$ 36.36 - R$ 54.55 /h
* **Important:** The hourly rate charged to the client must consider social charges (approx. 70-80%), operational costs (infrastructure, equipment, benefits, etc.) (taxes), and profit margin. Generally, the gross salary is multiplied by a factor between 2.5 and 4.

**Example of Charged Hourly Rate (VHC):**
**Junior:** R$ 60 - R$ 100 /h
**Mid-level:** R$ 100 - R$ 140 /h
**Senior:** R$ 140 - R$ 200 /h

**Adjust these values ​​according to the type of project (internal, outsourcing, own product, etc.).**

**5. Calculation of Labor Cost**

**5.1.** Calculate the total cost based on the team's unique profile:**
* `Cost = (Total Project Hours) X (Hourly Rate Charged per Profile)`
* Example (considering a Full Stack Developer for the entire project):

* Full Stack Developer: 288h X R$ 120/h = **R$ 34,560**

**6. Add Indirect Costs and Margins**

* **6.1. Indirect Costs:** Includes infrastructure (servers, software licenses, management tools), testing, documentation, project management, meetings, reviews, training, etc.

* A percentage of the labor cost can be adopted (e.g., 10% to 20%).
* Example: R$ 34,560 X 1.15 = R$ 39,744
* **6.2. Profit Margin:** Add the desired margin (e.g., 20% to 30%).
* Example: R$ 39,744 x 1.25 = **R$ 49,680**

**7. Final Budget Presentation**

* **7.1. Document the scope:** Detail what is or is not included in the project.

* **7.2. Estimated Schedule:** Based on total hours and allocation of the single team.

* **7.3. Billing Method:** By fixed project, by hour, by sprint, etc.

* **7.4. Issue the Budget:** With the total calculated value (R$ 49,680 in the example above), justifications, and deadline.
